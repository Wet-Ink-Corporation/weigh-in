rem Weigh-In launcher for cmd: runs the prebuilt binary from libexec\TARGET\.
rem The msvc build wins unless the gnu build is newer, as in the sh launcher, B-05: a stale
rem native build must not shadow a fresh cross-build, since they share one ledger and versions
rem differ in journal mode. Falls back to a weighin.exe on PATH.
rem The age test is xcopy /D /L: it lists the gnu build only when that is newer than the msvc
rem one, and copies nothing. Matching the file name rather than the File-count summary keeps it
rem independent of the Windows display language; both tools are named by path so a Unix find
rem earlier on PATH, as Git for Windows can put there, is never picked up.
rem The binary runs outside any parenthesised block, and exit /b names its errorlevel, so the
rem caller sees the binary's exit code.
