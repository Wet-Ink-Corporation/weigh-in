//! The exchange format with the Artifact board: the state document Claude pushes to
//! `board/state`, and the answer documents the page writes under `answers/<item id>`.
//!
//! The page is `plugin/skills/weigh-in/assets/board.html`. It reads these documents by field
//! name, so the field names here are the page's and renaming one breaks the board.
//!
//! Answers read back are untrusted input (any viewer with edit rights can write them), so
//! [`validate_answer`] checks every field against the ledger before anything is applied, and
//! free text is only ever stored as a note.
